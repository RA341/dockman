## **Why Dockman**

I built dockman because I wanted a text editor on a web UI. That's it.

I like writing compose files, but I was sick of the command line dance. And I sure as hell didn't want another tool with
Enterprise™ bloat, nested menus, or a million config switches.

Dockman stays simple and focused. By design.

### Comparisons

**Portainer:** Too enterprisey, to many different toggles and features I don't need in a homelab context. Notably it is
not transparent in where it keeps its compose files.

**Dockge:** I don't use the UI editor. Once you've written compose files a few times, you don't need a GUI slowing you
down, typing is faster. Also, it doesn't support editing other files such as envs or yaml. Not to mention the node ram
usage, in this economy every MiB counts.
