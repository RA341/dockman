## **Why Dockman**

I built Dockman because I wanted a simple, focused Docker management tool.

My setup revolves entirely around Docker Compose, every container I run is part of a stack. I needed a web UI with a
straightforward text editor where I could write my configs and deploy with a single button click. I enjoy writing
compose files, but typing `cd somefolder && docker compose -f some-compose.yml up -d` over and over got old fast.

So I built Dockman: no deeply nested menus, no Enterprise™ feature bloat, no paywalls. Everything is accessible and
managed through a clean, (mostly) keyboard-friendly web UI.

Dockman is for people who know their way around Docker and prefer working directly with compose files, no abstractions,
no distractions. If that sounds like you, you'll feel right at home.

**Dockman is for people who:**

* Prefer editing configuration files directly instead of clicking through GUIs
* Care more about simplicity than having every feature under the sun
* Enjoy working fast with keyboard shortcuts

If that sounds like you, give it a star. If not, I’d still love to hear what you think is missing.
