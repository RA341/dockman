# File Explorer

Dockman includes a full-featured file explorer for managing your Docker compose files and configs.

## Features

- **Basic operations** — Create, delete, rename, and move files
- **Quick search** — Jump to any file instantly with the search bar
- **File aliases** — Browse directories outside your compose root (like `/var/lib/docker` or `/opt/appdata`)
- **SQLite browser** — View and edit `.db` files with a built-in GUI
- **YAML formatting** — Auto-format compose files with `Alt + L`

Search for `docker-compose.yml`, edit it with YAML formatting, then switch to a file alias to
modify a container's config, all without leaving Dockman.
