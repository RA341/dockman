### About The UI

* I'm not a UI guy; in fact, I hate HTML/CSS in general. The current interface is mostly built using Material-UI
  and Gemini and designed for my preferences.
* If you have ideas on how to make it look better or easier to use, I'm all ears. Feel free to open
  a [discussion](https://github.com/RA341/dockman/discussions) with your suggestions.
